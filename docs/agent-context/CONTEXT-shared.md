# Collective Will v0 — Shared Context

Every agent receives this file. It is the ground truth for the project.

---

## What This Project Is

Collective Will surfaces what Iranians collectively want. During MVP build/testing, users submit concerns via Telegram, AI agents organize and cluster them, and the community votes on priorities. WhatsApp transport is integrated after MVP once SIM operations are ready. Everything is transparent and auditable.

**v0 goal**: Consensus visibility + per-policy stance voting with LLM-generated options. No action execution (deferred to v1).

**Pilot**: Iran (diaspora + inside-Iran).

## v0 Frozen Decisions

These are locked. Do not deviate.

| Decision | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **Scope** | Consensus visibility + per-policy stance voting only. No action drafting or execution. |
| **Channel** | Telegram-first for MVP build/testing (official Bot API) while preserving channel-agnostic boundaries (`BaseChannel`). WhatsApp (Evolution API, self-hosted) is deferred until post-MVP rollout once anonymous SIM operations are ready. Keep provider-specific parsing in channel adapters and test with mock/fake channels so transport swaps remain one-module changes. |
| **Canonicalization model** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (any language → structured English). Runs inline at submission time with batch fallback. Accepts positions, questions, concerns, and expressions of interest about policy topics — not just explicit stances. Fallback: Gemini 3.1 Pro. |
| **LLM routing abstraction** | Model/provider resolution is centralized in `pipeline/llm.py` via config-backed task tiers. No direct model IDs in other modules. |
| **LLM model strategy** | Claude-first: all primary tiers default to `claude-sonnet-4-6` for reliable throughput (Gemini 3.1 Pro hit 25 RPD limit). All fallbacks default to `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Model selection is config-backed — switch any tier via env without code changes. |
| **Embeddings** | Gemini-first in v0: `gemini-embedding-001` (primary), `text-embedding-3-large` (fallback). Model selection/fallback controlled by config. |
| **Cluster summaries** | `english_reasoning` tier defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.6. Mandatory fallback (Gemini 3.1 Pro) is required for risk management via abstraction config. |
| **Policy option generation** | Web-grounded via `option_generation` tier: defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.6 (no grounding). Google Search grounding activates automatically on Gemini fallback. Full (untruncated) citizen submissions are passed to the LLM alongside web search for real-world policy context. |
| **User-facing messages** | Locale-aware (Farsi + English, keyed by `user.locale`). LLM-generated content (rejection reasons) matches the input language. Template-based messages (confirmation, errors) use the `_MESSAGES` dict with locale selection. LLM tier `farsi_messages` defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.6 with mandatory fallback (Gemini 3.1 Pro) via abstraction config. |
| **Clustering** | LLM-driven policy-key grouping. Each submission is assigned a stance-neutral `policy_topic` (browsing umbrella, e.g., "internet-censorship") and `policy_key` (ballot-level discussion, e.g., "political-internet-censorship") at canonicalization time. Clusters are persistent entities keyed by `policy_key`. Periodic hybrid normalization (embedding cosine similarity at 0.55 threshold + LLM key remapping with full summaries) merges near-duplicate keys across all topics; LLM may create new canonical key names. |
| **Identity** | Email magic-link + WhatsApp account linking. No phone verification, no OAuth, no vouching. Signup controls: exempt major email providers from per-domain cap; enforce `MAX_SIGNUPS_PER_DOMAIN_PER_DAY=3` for non-major domains; enforce per-IP signup cap (`MAX_SIGNUPS_PER_IP_PER_DAY`) and keep telemetry signals (domain diversity, disposable-domain scoring, velocity logs). |
| **Sealed account mapping** | Store messaging linkage as random opaque account refs (UUIDv4). Raw platform IDs (Telegram chat_id, WhatsApp wa_id) live only in the `sealed_account_mappings` DB table and are stripped from logs/exports. The sealed mapping is persisted to database (not in-memory) so it survives restarts. |
| **Auth token persistence** | Magic link tokens and linking codes are stored in the `verification_tokens` DB table with expiry timestamps. No in-memory token storage — tokens must survive process restarts and be shared across background workers. |
| **Authenticated web API identity** | `/user/*` and `/ops/*` must use backend-verified bearer tokens derived from the magic-link web session flow. Do not trust client-provided identity headers (for example `x-user-email`) for authenticated access control. Keep bearer signing secret backend-only via `WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. |
| **Submission eligibility** | Verified account + account age >= 48 hours in production. Threshold is config-backed via `MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_HOURS` (default `48`) so test/dev can override lower values. |
| **Vote eligibility** | Verified account + age >= 48h + at least 1 accepted contribution in production. Accepted contribution = processed submission OR pre-ballot policy endorsement signature. Age threshold config-backed via `MIN_ACCOUNT_AGE_HOURS` (default `48`). Contribution requirement config-backed via `REQUIRE_CONTRIBUTION_FOR_VOTE` (default `true`). Staging/test can override both. |
| **Pre-ballot signatures** | Multi-stage approval is required before ballot: clusters must pass size threshold and collect enough distinct endorsement signatures (`MIN_PREBALLOT_ENDORSEMENTS`, default `5`) before entering final approval ballot. |
| **Voting cycle duration** | Config-backed via `VOTING_CYCLE_HOURS` (default `48`). Staging can use shorter cycles for testing. |
| **Submission daily limit** | Config-backed via `MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY` (default `5`). Staging can raise for testing. |
| **Adjudication autonomy** | Individual votes, disputes, and quarantine outcomes are resolved by autonomous agentic workflows (primary model + fallback/ensemble as needed). Humans do not manually decide per-item outcomes; human actions are limited to architecture, policy tuning, and risk-management incidents. |
| **Evidence store** | PostgreSQL append-only hash-chain. No UPDATE/DELETE. |
| **External anchoring** | Merkle root computation is required in v0 (daily). Publishing that root to Witness.co is optional and config-driven. |
| **Ops observability console** | Add a separate `/ops` diagnostics surface for runtime health/events. In dev/staging it may appear in top navigation; in production it must be admin-auth gated and feature-flagged. Show structured, redacted operational events (health checks, recent errors, job status, webhook/email transport status), not raw container logs. |
| **Infrastructure** | Njalla domain is registered (WHOIS privacy). Primary hosting is 1984.is VPS. Cloudflare (Free plan) is **active** as the edge proxy — DNS, CDN, DDoS protection, and Bot Fight Mode enabled. Caddy `trusted_proxies static` is configured with all Cloudflare IP ranges + `trusted_proxies_strict` to preserve real client IPs. Production domain serves a static 503 maintenance page until the production stack is deployed (staging is the active environment). Deploy pipeline includes preflight checks, pull retries with backoff, and post-deploy health gates. Origin IP is private. Operator failover playbook + standby VPS must be documented. |
| **Web dependency security** | Next.js ≥15.5.12, React ≥19.0.1 (patched for CVE-2025-66478). No wget/curl in web runtime image. Deploy SSH timeout 10m — do not lengthen to mask anomalies. Full incident context: `docs/agent-context/security/01-nextjs-rce-cryptomining-2025-03.md`. |
| **Telegram webhook verification** | When `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, the Telegram webhook endpoint verifies the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header using `hmac.compare_digest`. The same secret must be passed to Telegram's `setWebhook` API. |
| **Auth endpoint rate limiting** | In-process sliding-window rate limiters protect auth endpoints: `/auth/subscribe` (5/min/IP), `/auth/verify` (10/min/IP), `/auth/web-session` (5/min/IP). Disputes are limited to 3/hour/user. Voice verification is limited to 5/hour/user. Implementation: `src/api/rate_limit.py`. For horizontal scaling, replace with Redis-backed counters. |
| **Generic auth error messages** | Auth failure responses use generic messages ("Invalid or expired verification link", "Invalid or expired session code") to prevent account enumeration. Internal error codes (e.g., `invalid_token`, `expired_token`, `user_not_found`) are not exposed to clients. |
| **IP resolution** | `get_request_ip()` in `src/api/rate_limit.py` prefers `CF-Connecting-IP` (non-spoofable behind Cloudflare) over `X-Forwarded-For`. All auth routes use this function for IP-based rate limiting. |
| **CORS policy** | Backend CORS allows only explicit origins (from `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`), methods `GET/POST/OPTIONS`, and headers `Content-Type/Authorization`. No wildcard methods or headers. |
| **Security headers** | Caddy sets `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` on all staging responses. `Server` header is stripped. |
| **Token consumption atomicity** | `consume_token()` in `src/db/verification_tokens.py` uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` + `flush()` to prevent TOCTOU race conditions on concurrent token redemption. |
| **Voice signature verification** | Dual verification (SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN 192-dim embedding + faster-whisper transcription) via separate `voice-service` Docker container. Enrollment: 3 phrases from pool of 100/language → averaged embedding stored as `LargeBinary`. Verification: 1 random phrase per session start → 30-min session window extended on Submit/Vote/Endorse. Decision matrix: high sim (≥0.50) + transcription ≥0.70 → accept; moderate sim (≥0.35) + transcription ≥0.90 → accept; else reject. Evidence logs scores + phrase_id only (no biometric data). Implementation: `src/voice/`, `voice-service/`. |

### Abuse Thresholds

| Control | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Submissions per account per day | 5 |
| Accounts per email domain per day | 3 (non-major domains only; major providers exempt) |
| Signups per requester IP per day | 10 |
| Burst quarantine trigger | 3 submissions/5 minutes from one account (soft quarantine: accept + flag for review) |
| Vote changes per cycle | 1 full vote re-submission per cycle (total max: 2 vote submissions/cycle). |
| Failed verification attempts | 5 per email per 24h, then 24h lockout |
| Auth endpoint rate limits | subscribe: 5/min/IP, verify: 10/min/IP, web-session: 5/min/IP (in-process sliding window) |
| Dispute rate limit | 3 disputes per hour per user |
| Voice verification rate limit | 5 attempts per user per hour (enforced before inference) |

### Dispute Handling

- Users flag bad canonicalization or cluster assignment from their dashboard.
- Autonomous dispute-resolution workflow completes within 72 hours (SLA target).
- Resolver can escalate to a stronger model or multi-model ensemble when confidence is low.
- Dispute adjudication must use explicit confidence thresholds with fallback/ensemble paths when below threshold.
- Scope dispute resolution to the disputed submission first (re-canonicalize that item); do not re-run full clustering mid-cycle for a single dispute.
- Disputed items tracked via evidence chain (`dispute_resolved`, optionally `dispute_escalated`) but never removed or suppressed.
- Resolution logged to evidence store. Resolution is by re-running pipeline, not manual content override.
- Every adjudication action (primary decision, fallback/ensemble escalation, final resolution) must be evidence-logged.
- Track dispute volume and resolver-disagreement metrics; if disputes exceed 5% of cycle submissions (or disagreement spikes), tune model/prompt/policy.

### Data Retention

| Data | Deletable on user request? |
|------|---------------------------|
| Evidence chain entries | No (chain integrity) |
| Account linkage (email ↔ wa_id mapping) | Yes (GDPR) |
| Opaque user refs in evidence chain | No (but unlinkable after account deletion) |
| Raw submissions in evidence chain | No (user link severed; text preserved anonymously) |
| Votes | No (pseudonymous; user link severed on deletion) |

PII safety rule: run automated pre-persist PII detection on incoming submissions. If high-risk PII is detected, do not store the text; ask the user to redact personal identifiers and resend. Keep pipeline PII stripping as a secondary safety layer.

## Web Authentication Flow

End-to-end login process. All agents modifying auth, deploy, or frontend routing must
understand this flow.

### Token Types

| Token | Purpose | Expiry | Storage |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| `magic_link` | Email verification URL | 15 min | `verification_tokens` DB table |
| `linking_code` | Telegram account linking | 60 min | `verification_tokens` DB table |
| `web_session` | One-time code exchanged for bearer token | 10 min | `verification_tokens` DB table |
| Bearer (access) token | Authenticated API access | 30 days | Signed with `WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` (HMAC-SHA256), stored in NextAuth JWT cookie |

### Caddy Routing for `/api/auth/*`

The `/api/auth/*` namespace is split between two services:

- **Backend** (FastAPI): `/api/auth/subscribe`, `/api/auth/verify/*`, `/api/auth/web-session`
- **Web** (NextAuth): all other `/api/auth/*` (session, callback, csrf, etc.)

Use `handle` + `uri strip_prefix /api` for backend routes. **Never use `handle_path`** for
these — it strips the entire matched prefix, breaking the backend routing.
NextAuth routes keep their full `/api/auth/...` path (no stripping).

### Server-Side vs Client-Side API Base

| Context | Environment variable | Resolved value |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Client-side (browser JS) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (build-time) | `/api` → goes through Caddy |
| Server-side (NextAuth authorize) | `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` (runtime) | `http://backend:8000` → direct container network |
| Server-side (SSR pages, ops) | `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` via `resolveApiBase()` | `http://backend:8000` → direct container network |

The `web/lib/api.ts` helper auto-selects: `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` on the server,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in the browser.

### Ops Console Access

- Same bearer-token auth as dashboard — no separate admin credentials
- Staging: `OPS_CONSOLE_REQUIRE_ADMIN=false` (any authenticated user)
- Production: `OPS_CONSOLE_REQUIRE_ADMIN=true` + `OPS_ADMIN_EMAILS` list
- Feature-flagged via `OPS_CONSOLE_ENABLED` and `OPS_CONSOLE_SHOW_IN_NAV`

### NavBar Session Awareness

The server layout calls `auth()` and passes `userEmail` to NavBar as a prop.
When logged in: shows user email. When not: shows "Sign Up" button.
After verification, `router.refresh()` re-renders the server layout to update NavBar.

---

## Active Implementation Plan

Execution priorities for the current remediation cycle are tracked in:

- `docs/agent-context/ACTIVE-action-plan.md`

Agents implementing changes should follow that plan order unless the user explicitly re-prioritizes.

---

## Data Models

Implement as Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses (Python) and SQLAlchemy ORM models for DB.

Model conversion rule: define explicit ORM<->schema conversion methods (for example, `User.from_orm()` / `db_user.to_schema()`), and test round-trip field parity. Avoid ad-hoc dict mapping between ORM and Pydantic layers.

candidate_ids: list[UUID]
member_count: int
approval_count: int
needs_resummarize: bool             # True when cluster needs ballot question (re)generation
last_summarized_count: int          # member_count at last summarization (for growth detection)
created_at: datetime
evidence_log_id: int
```

Cluster lifecycle: `open` → `archived` (when included in a voting cycle via `open_cycle()`). New submissions with the same `policy_key` create a fresh open cluster. Only open clusters are processed by the pipeline (summarization, ballot questions, options, agenda, normalization, key merges) and shown in the Telegram endorsement flow.

### Vote

```
id: UUID
user_id: UUID
cycle_id: UUID
approved_cluster_ids: list[UUID]    # Derived from selections when present; kept for backward compatibility
selections: list[dict] | None       # JSONB — per-policy stance selections [{cluster_id, option_id}, ...]
created_at: datetime
evidence_log_id: int
```

### PolicyEndorsement

```
id: UUID
user_id: UUID
cluster_id: UUID
created_at: datetime
evidence_log_id: int
```

### PolicyOption

```
id: UUID
cluster_id: UUID                    # FK to clusters
position: int                       # 1-based display order
label: str                          # Farsi label (e.g., "حمایت از این سیاست")
label_en: str | None                # English label
description: str                    # Farsi — concrete trade-offs, pros & cons
description_en: str | None          # English description
model_version: str                  # LLM model that generated the option
created_at: datetime
evidence_log_id: int | None
```

Generated by `src/pipeline/options.py` after cluster summarization. Each cluster receives 2–4 distinct stance options. Fallback (support/oppose) is used if LLM generation fails.

### VotingCycle

```
id: UUID
started_at: datetime
ends_at: datetime
status: "active" | "closed" | "tallied"
cluster_ids: list[UUID]
results: list[{cluster_id, approval_count, approval_rate, option_counts?}] | None
total_voters: int
evidence_log_id: int
```

### EvidenceLogEntry

```
id: int (BIGSERIAL)
timestamp: datetime
event_type: str                     # See valid event types below
entity_type: str
entity_id: UUID
payload: dict                       # JSONB — enriched with human-readable context (see Evidence Payload Enrichment)
hash: str                           # SHA-256(canonical JSON of {timestamp,event_type,entity_type,entity_id,payload,prev_hash})
prev_hash: str                      # previous entry's hash (chain)
```

Valid event types (enforced by `VALID_EVENT_TYPES` in `src/db/evidence.py`):
```
submission_received, submission_rejected_not_policy, candidate_created,
cluster_created, cluster_updated, cluster_merged, ballot_question_generated,
policy_endorsed, policy_options_generated,
vote_cast, cycle_opened, cycle_closed, user_verified, dispute_escalated,
dispute_resolved, dispute_metrics_recorded, dispute_tuning_recommended,
anchor_computed, voice_enrolled, voice_verified
```

Removed event types (clean slate — no backward compatibility):
- `user_created` — redundant; `user_verified` is the meaningful identity event
- `dispute_opened` — redundant; disputes are immediately resolved, so only `dispute_resolved` (and optionally `dispute_escalated`) matter

### IPSignupLog (operational — `src/db/ip_signup_log.py`)

```
id: int (BIGSERIAL)
requester_ip: str               # IPv4/IPv6, max 45 chars
email_domain: str               # Domain portion of signup email
created_at: datetime             # server_default=now()
```

DB-backed IP rate-limiting table. Replaces the former in-memory `_IP_SIGNUP_COUNTER` / `_IP_DOMAIN_TRACKER` dicts. Queried by `check_signup_ip_rate()` and `check_signup_domain_diversity_by_ip()` in `src/handlers/abuse.py`. Written to by `record_account_creation_velocity()`. Indexes: composite `(requester_ip, created_at)` for rate-window lookups, `(created_at)` for periodic cleanup.

### Evidence Payload Enrichment

All `append_evidence` payloads include human-readable context so the evidence chain is self-describing. Key fields per event type:

| Event type | Required payload fields |
|---|---|
| `submission_received` | `submission_id`, `user_id`, `raw_text`, `language`, `status`, `hash` (or `status`+`reason_code` for PII rejections) |
| `submission_rejected_not_policy` | `submission_id`, `rejection_reason`, `model_version`, `prompt_version` |
| `candidate_created` | `submission_id`, `title`, `summary`, `stance`, `policy_topic`, `policy_key`, `confidence`, `model_version`, `prompt_version` |
| `cluster_updated` | `summary`, `member_count`, `candidate_ids`, `model_version` |
| `cluster_merged` | `survivor_key`, `merged_key`, `merged_cluster_id`, `new_member_count` |
| `ballot_question_generated` | `policy_key`, `ballot_question`, `member_count`, `model_version` |
| `vote_cast` | `user_id`, `cycle_id`, `approved_cluster_ids`, `selections` (when per-policy voting) |
| `policy_endorsed` | `user_id`, `cluster_id` |
| `policy_options_generated` | `cluster_id`, `option_count`, `model_version`, `option_labels` |
| `cycle_opened` | `cycle_id`, `cluster_ids`, `starts_at`, `ends_at`, `cycle_duration_hours` |
| `cycle_closed` | `total_voters`, `results` |
| `user_verified` | `user_id`, `method` |
| `dispute_resolved` | `submission_id`, `candidate_id`, `escalated`, `confidence`, `model_version`, `resolved_title`, `resolved_summary`, `resolution_seconds` |
| `dispute_escalated` | `threshold`, `primary_model`, `primary_confidence`, `ensemble_models`, `selected_model`, `selected_confidence` |

### Evidence PII Stripping

The public `GET /analytics/evidence` endpoint strips PII keys from payloads before serving:
- Stripped keys: `user_id`, `email`, `account_ref`, `wa_id`
- `raw_text` is preserved (it's the civic concern, not PII)
- Internal evidence entries retain `user_id` for audit integrity; it's only stripped from the public API response
- This supports coercion resistance: no transferable proof linking a user to a specific action

### Evidence API Contract

- `GET /analytics/evidence` — paginated, with `entity_id`, `event_type`, `page`, `per_page` query params; returns `{total, page, per_page, entries}`
- `GET /analytics/evidence/verify` — server-side chain verification; returns `{valid, entries_checked}`
- Frontend evidence explorer uses server-side verify (no client-side hash recomputation); deep links to analytics pages via `entityLink()`

## What's In Scope (v0)

- Telegram submission intake (official Bot API) for MVP build/testing
- Button-only Telegram UX (inline keyboards, no typed commands — reduces misinterpretation)
- Email magic-link verification
- Messaging account linking with opaque account refs (Telegram now; WhatsApp mapping path prepared)
- Canonicalization (Claude Sonnet, cloud, inline at submission time with batch fallback; always outputs English)
- Garbage rejection (LLM detects invalid submissions, rejects with user-language feedback; garbage counts against daily quota)
- Embeddings (quality-first cloud model in v0; computed inline after canonicalization)
- Clustering (LLM-driven policy-key grouping, batch on hybrid trigger: `BATCH_THRESHOLD` unprocessed submissions OR `PIPELINE_INTERVAL_HOURS` max interval)
- LLM-generated per-policy stance options (2–4 options per cluster via `pipeline/options.py`)
- Pre-ballot endorsement/signature stage for cluster qualification
- Per-policy stance voting via Telegram (paginated one-policy-at-a-time flow with summary review)
- Public analytics dashboard (no login wall)
- User dashboard (submissions, votes, disputes)
- Evidence store (hash-chain in Postgres)
- Farsi + English UI (RTL support)
- Audit evidence explorer
- Ops observability console (`/ops`) for redacted runtime diagnostics in dev/staging, with optional admin-only production mode
- Abuse controls (rate limits, quarantine)

## What's Out of Scope (v0)

- Action execution / drafting
- Signal
- WhatsApp rollout during MVP build/testing (deferred to post-MVP once anonymous SIMs arrive)
- Phone verification, OAuth, vouching
- Quadratic/conviction voting
- Federation / decentralization
- Blockchain anchoring (required)
- Mobile app
- Demographic collection
- Public/anonymous access to raw runtime or Docker/container logs

## Process Rules — EVERY AGENT MUST FOLLOW

1. **Test after every task**: When you finish implementing a task, write unit tests for what you just built. Tests go in `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure. Use pytest (Python) or vitest (TypeScript). Run tests and confirm they pass before moving to the next task.
2. **Type hints everywhere**: All Python functions have type annotations. Run mypy in strict mode.
3. **Pydantic for all models**: All data models are Pydantic BaseModel subclasses. SQLAlchemy models are separate but aligned.
4. **Parameterized queries only**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM. No string concatenation for SQL.
5. **Use `secrets` not `random`**: For any crypto/token generation.
6. **No eval/exec**: Never execute dynamic code.
7. **Ruff for formatting**: Run ruff before finishing.
8. **Never commit secrets**: `.env` is gitignored. No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code.
9. **OpSec**: No real names in commits/comments/code. No hardcoded paths containing usernames. Store only opaque account refs in core tables/logs; raw `wa_id` is allowed only in the sealed mapping.
10. **No per-item human adjudication**: Humans do not manually approve/reject single votes, disputes, or quarantined submissions. They may only change policy/config, architecture, and risk-management controls.
