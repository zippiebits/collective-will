# Task: Message Command Router (Button-Only UX)

## Depends on
- `messaging/03-webhook-endpoint` (route_message stub)
- `messaging/04-submission-intake` (handle_submission)
- `messaging/07-voting-service` (cast_vote, record_endorsement)
- `messaging/01-channel-base-types` (BaseChannel, UnifiedMessage, OutboundMessage)
- `database/03-core-models` (User, VotingCycle, Cluster, PolicyOption queries)

## Goal
Implement a button-only Telegram UX that dispatches all user interactions through inline keyboard callbacks. Users never type commands — all actions are selected via buttons. The voting flow presents one policy at a time with LLM-generated stance options, a summary review page, and final submission.

## Files to create/modify

- `src/handlers/commands.py` — callback router and all interaction flows

## Specification

### Interaction Model: Button-Only

All user interaction is driven by Telegram inline keyboards (callback queries). There are no typed commands. The main menu is an inline keyboard sent after linking, after each action completes, and when unrecognized text is received.

### Main Menu Buttons

| Button Label (en) | Button Label (fa) | Callback Data |
|---|---|---|
| Submit a concern | ارسال نگرانی | `submit` |
| Vote | رای دادن | `vote` |
| Endorse policies | امضای سیاست | `endorse` |
| Change language | تغییر زبان | `lang` |

### State Machine

User interaction state is tracked via two columns on the `User` model:

- `bot_state: str | None` — current high-level state (e.g., `"awaiting_submission"`, `"voting"`)
- `bot_state_data: dict | None` — JSONB session data for multi-step flows

#### States

| State | Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `None` (default) | Any text | Show menu hint + main menu keyboard |
| `None` | Callback `submit` | Set state to `awaiting_submission`, prompt user to type concern |
| `enrolling_voice` | Voice message | Process enrollment audio (multi-step: 3 phrases) |
| `enrolling_voice` | Text | Nudge: "Please send a voice message" |
| `awaiting_voice` | Voice message | Verify against stored embedding |
| `awaiting_voice` | Text | Nudge: "Please send a voice message" |
| `awaiting_submission` | Any text | Route to `handle_submission()`, clear state, show menu |
| `None` | Callback `vote` | Initialize voting session (see below) |
| `voting` | Callbacks `vo:N`, `vsk`, `vbk`, `vchg`, `vsub` | Navigate per-policy voting flow |
| `None` | Callback `endorse` | Initialize endorsement session (see below) |
| `endorsing` | Callbacks `e:N`, `esk`, `ebk` | Navigate per-cluster endorsement flow |
| Any | Callback `cancel` | Clear state + state_data, show menu |
| Any | Callback `lang` | Toggle locale, show menu in new language |

### Per-Policy Voting Flow

When the user taps "Vote on policies":

1. **Session initialization**: Query active `VotingCycle`, load `cluster_ids`. Store session in `bot_state_data`:
   ```json
   {
     "cycle_id": "...",
     "cluster_ids": ["...", "..."],
     "current_idx": 0,
     "selections": {}
   }
   ```
   Set `bot_state = "voting"`.

2. **Policy display** (one at a time): Show "Policy X of N", cluster summary (locale-aware), then each `PolicyOption` as an inline keyboard button. Navigation buttons: Skip (→), Back (←).

3. **Option select** (`vo:{position}`): Record selection in `bot_state_data["selections"][cluster_id] = option_id`, advance to next policy.

4. **Skip** (`vsk`): Advance without recording a selection.

5. **Back** (`vbk`): Decrement `current_idx`, re-show previous policy.

6. **Auto-submit** (after last policy): Show all selections with labels, then automatically submit the vote by converting `selections` dict to `[{cluster_id, option_id}, ...]` and calling `cast_vote()`. Clear state, show confirmation + analytics link + menu. No extra confirmation step required.

### Endorsement Flow (Pre-Ballot)

When the user taps "Endorse policies":

1. **Session initialization**: Query clusters with `ballot_question IS NOT NULL` and `status='open'` that are NOT in any active `VotingCycle`. Query user's existing endorsements for display. Store session in `bot_state_data`:
   ```json
   {
     "endorsing": true,
     "cluster_ids": ["...", "..."],
     "current_idx": 0,
     "endorsed": ["..."]
   }
   ```
   Set `bot_state = "endorsing"`.

2. **Cluster display** (one at a time): Show locale-aware ballot question, member count, endorsement count. If already endorsed, show label and hide Endorse button. Navigation: Endorse, Skip, Back, Cancel.

3. **Endorse** (`e:{1-based-index}`): Call `record_endorsement()`, mark in session, advance to next.

4. **Skip** (`esk`): Advance without endorsing.

5. **Back** (`ebk`): Go back to previous cluster.

6. **Done** (after last cluster): Clear state, return to main menu.

### Callback Data Encoding

Compact strings to fit Telegram's 64-byte limit:

| Action | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Option select | `vo:{position}` | `vo:2` |
| Skip policy | `vsk` | |
| Back to prev | `vbk` | |
| Change answers | `vchg` | |
| Submit vote | `vsub` | |
| Endorse cluster | `e:{index}` | `e:3` |
| Skip endorsement | `esk` | |
| Back (endorsement) | `ebk` | |
| Submit concern | `submit` | |
| Vote menu | `vote` | |
| Endorse menu | `endorse` | |
| Language toggle | `lang` | |
| Cancel | `cancel` | |

### Locale-Aware Messages

All user-facing text is stored in `_MESSAGES: dict[str, dict[str, str]]` with `"en"` and `"fa"` keys. The `_msg(locale, key, **kwargs)` helper selects the appropriate language based on `user.locale`.

### Analytics Deep Links

After submission or voting, include a link to the public analytics page:
- Submission: `{app_public_base_url}/{locale}/analytics`
- Vote: `{app_public_base_url}/{locale}/analytics?cycle={cycle_id}`

### route_message() Implementation

```python
async def route_message(
    session: AsyncSession, message: UnifiedMessage, channel: BaseChannel
) -> str:
```

1. If `callback_data` present → look up user, dispatch to `_route_callback()`
2. Else look up user by `sender_ref`
3. If user not found and text matches linking code → handle linking (then auto-start voice enrollment)
4. If user not found → send bilingual registration prompt
5. **Voice gate** (after user lookup, before action dispatch):
   a. Voice message → `_handle_voice_message()` (routes to enrollment or verification handler)
   b. Not voice-enrolled → prompt enrollment (send voice to start)
   c. Enrolled but session expired → prompt verification (send voice)
   d. Text during `"enrolling_voice"` or `"awaiting_voice"` → resend voice prompt (nudge)
6. If `bot_state == "awaiting_submission"` → route to `handle_submission()`
7. Else → show menu hint with keyboard

Returns a status string for logging/testing (e.g., `"policy_shown"`, `"vote_recorded"`, `"menu_resent"`).

## Constraints

- No typed commands — all interaction through inline keyboard callbacks.
- During voting, `bot_state_data` stores the full session. State is persisted to DB so it survives bot restarts.
- After every completed action (submit, vote, cancel, lang), automatically return to main menu.
- Keep routing based on `UnifiedMessage` + `BaseChannel` — no Telegram-specific payload checks in router logic.
- All responses use the user's preferred locale (`user.locale`).

## Tests

Tests in `tests/test_handlers/test_commands.py` covering:
- Unknown user → registration prompt
- Successful linking → welcome message with menu
- Callback `submit` → sets `awaiting_submission` state
- Text in awaiting state → triggers submission, clears state
- Callback `cancel` → clears state and state_data
- Callback `lang` → toggles locale
- Callback `vote` with no active cycle → no_active_cycle message
- Callback `vote` with active cycle → shows first policy with options
- `vo:N` → advances to next policy, records selection
- `vsk` → skips without selection
- `vbk` → goes back to previous policy
- `vsub` → calls cast_vote with selections, clears state (backward compat)
- `vsub` with empty selections → returns to menu
- `vsub` with expired cycle → no_active_cycle
- `vsub` with rejection → shows error message
- `vo:N` without active session → returns to menu
- `vchg` → resets to first policy (backward compat)
- Last policy option select → auto-submits vote and returns to menu
- Callback `endorse` with no endorsable clusters → no_endorsable_clusters message
- Callback `endorse` with endorsable clusters → shows first cluster with ballot question
- `e:{N}` from endorsement session → records endorsement, advances to next
- `e:{N}` without endorsement session → returns to menu
- `esk` → advances without endorsing
- `ebk` → goes back to previous cluster
- Last cluster endorsed/skipped → clears state, returns to menu
- Active cycle clusters excluded from endorsement list
- Archived clusters excluded from endorsement list (only `status='open'` shown)
- Last policy option select → auto-submits vote, shows summary + confirmation
- Unrecognized text → re-sends menu
- Bilingual message content verification

Additional voice-related tests in `tests/test_handlers/test_commands_voice.py`:
- Not-enrolled user text → enrollment prompt
- Not-enrolled user voice → starts enrollment
- Enrolled + expired session text → verification prompt
- Enrolled + active session text → passes through to menu
- Rate-limited verification → rate limit message
