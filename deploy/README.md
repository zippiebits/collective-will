# VPS Deployment Setup

Remaining setup steps for GitHub Actions CI/CD. Docker and the `deploy` user
are already configured on the VPS with SSH key access.

## Prerequisites

- A domain pointing to the VPS IP (A record for `yourdomain.com` and `staging.yourdomain.com`)

## 1. Export your existing SSH key as a GitHub Secret

You already have SSH key access to the VPS. Add the **private key** that
authenticates as the `deploy` user as a GitHub secret named `VPS_SSH_KEY`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/<your-deploy-key>
# Copy this output into GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions → VPS_SSH_KEY
```

## 2. Add all GitHub Secrets

Go to **GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret       | Value                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `VPS_HOST`   | Your VPS IP address or hostname              |
| `VPS_USER`   | `deploy`                                     |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Contents of the private key from step 1     |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically and gives GHCR push/pull access within the same repo.

Optionally add a **repository variable** (not secret):

| Variable         | Value                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `API_BASE_URL`   | e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/api`  |

## 3. Authenticate Docker on the VPS to pull from GHCR

SSH into the VPS as the deploy user and log in to GHCR. You need a GitHub
Personal Access Token (classic) with `read:packages` scope:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_VPS_IP
echo "YOUR_GITHUB_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

The credentials are stored in `~/.docker/config.json` and persist across reboots.

## 4. Create environment directories and secrets

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/collective-will/{production,staging,repo-deploy}
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /opt/collective-will
```

Create `.env.secrets` files for each environment. Start from the repo-root
`.env.secrets.example` template and fill in real values. Most secrets (API keys)
are shared; only `DB_PASSWORD` and `WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` differ per environment:

```bash
# Copy the template for each environment
cp /opt/collective-will/repo-deploy/.env.secrets.example /opt/collective-will/production/.env.secrets
cp /opt/collective-will/repo-deploy/.env.secrets.example /opt/collective-will/staging/.env.secrets

# Edit each file — fill in API keys (shared) and per-env DB_PASSWORD / WEB_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
nano /opt/collective-will/production/.env.secrets
nano /opt/collective-will/staging/.env.secrets
```

Secure the files:

```bash
chmod 600 /opt/collective-will/production/.env.secrets /opt/collective-will/staging/.env.secrets
```

### Voice phrases and env (preferred: one script)

Push all secrets and voice config in one go:

```bash
# From repo root: requires .env.secrets and optional voice-phrases.json
./scripts/push-env.sh staging    # or production
```

This pushes to the VPS: merged `.env`, `.env.secrets`, and `voice-phrases.json` (if present).
Deploy then uses `.env.secrets` when merging during `deploy.sh`. Create `voice-phrases.json` from
`voice-phrases.json.example` so voice verification works.

To copy voice-phrases only (manual):

```bash
scp voice-phrases.json deploy@YOUR_VPS:/opt/collective-will/production/voice-phrases.json
ssh deploy@YOUR_VPS "chmod 600 /opt/collective-will/production/voice-phrases.json"
```

During deploy, the workflow copies `deploy/public.env.production` and `deploy/public.env.staging`
from the repository to `/opt/collective-will/repo-deploy/`, and `deploy.sh` builds runtime
`/opt/collective-will/<env>/.env` by merging:
- public config from `public.env.<env>` (git-tracked, non-secret)
- secrets from `<env>/.env.secrets` (manual, from `.env.secrets.example` template)

If the same key exists in both files, the public value is kept and the duplicate in
`.env.secrets` is ignored with a warning in deploy logs.

For local development, `src/config.py` loads both `.env` (public) and `.env.secrets`
(secrets) automatically. See `.env.example` and `.env.secrets.example` for templates.

## 5. Install and configure Caddy

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y caddy
```

Copy the Caddyfile and set your domain:

```bash
sudo cp /opt/collective-will/repo-deploy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` and set the `DOMAIN` environment variable in the
Caddy systemd unit, or replace `{$DOMAIN}` with your actual domain:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit caddy
```

Add:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="DOMAIN=yourdomain.com"
```

Then reload:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

Caddy will automatically obtain TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

## 6. First deploy

After all the above, push to the `staging` branch to trigger the first deploy:

```bash
git push origin staging
```

Monitor the GitHub Actions run. Once it completes, verify:

```bash
curl -s https://staging.yourdomain.com/api/health
```

Then merge to `main` for production.

## Built-in Deploy Safeguards

`deploy/deploy.sh` now includes guard checks to reduce partial deploy risk:

- Preflight checks:
  - verifies compose has required services (`postgres`, `migrate`, `backend`, `scheduler`, `web`)
  - verifies GHCR reachability (`https://ghcr.io/v2/`)
  - verifies minimum disk and memory headroom
- Pull retries with backoff:
  - retries `docker compose pull` up to 3 times by default
- Post-deploy health checks:
  - verifies expected service count is running
  - verifies web/backend local ports respond
  - verifies Caddy host-header routing over both HTTP and HTTPS

The GitHub Actions workflow also skips Caddy apply when `deploy/Caddyfile`
has not changed, avoiding unnecessary Caddy reloads on app-only deploys.

### Optional tuning knobs

These environment variables can tune deploy behavior:

- `PULL_RETRIES` (default: `3`)
- `PULL_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` (default: `15`)
- `HEALTH_RETRIES` (default: `12`)
- `HEALTH_RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default: `3`)
- `MIN_DISK_AVAIL_GB` (default: `2`)
- `MIN_MEM_AVAIL_MB` (default: `256`)

```

## Caddy Routing

**Production** currently serves a static 503 maintenance page since the
production stack is not deployed yet.  When production is ready, replace
the `respond` block in the `{$DOMAIN}` server block with the same
`handle`/`reverse_proxy` routes from the staging block (using ports
8000/3000 instead of 8100/3100).

**Staging** Caddyfile splits `/api/auth/*` between two services:

- **Backend** (FastAPI): `/api/auth/subscribe`, `/api/auth/verify/*`, `/api/auth/web-session`
- **Web** (NextAuth): everything else under `/api/auth/*` (session, callback, etc.)

All other `/api/*` routes go to the backend. Everything else goes to the web frontend.

**Important**: Use `handle` + `uri strip_prefix /api` (not `handle_path`) for backend
routes. `handle_path` strips the *entire* matched prefix, which breaks the backend
routing. The backend expects paths like `/auth/subscribe`, so only `/api` should be
stripped. NextAuth routes must keep their full `/api/auth/...` path.

## Resetting Staging Data (Volume Nuke)

To wipe all staging data (database, evidence chain) and start fresh:

```bash
cd /opt/collective-will/staging
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

The `-v` flag removes all Docker volumes including the PostgreSQL data.
The `migrate` service will recreate the schema on startup.
A fresh genesis entry will be created on the first evidence append.

**Never run this on production without explicit confirmation.**

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check running containers
cd /opt/collective-will/production && docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f web

# Check Caddy status
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo journalctl -u caddy -f

# Manually pull and restart
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```
